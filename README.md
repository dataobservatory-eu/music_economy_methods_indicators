# Music Economy: Methods & Indicators

Indicators that capture the economic value of music in Europe are developed.
- Indicators developed in the Central European Music Industry Report are refined (which made use of 300 million
individual royalty statements).
- Indicators that bring transparency to music streaming and zero-marginal-price (free) uses of music are developed, as
well as indicators about the economic contributions of music to the national economy. A market comparator model for
valuing public performance and free uses, such as representative music streams (based on CEEMID ‘full market model’
and a DCF model) is developed.
- Design of an enterprise surveying method that is appropriate for MSMEs and freelancers, who are excluded from
current (official) data collection. The method will entail simple questions, simplified financial statements, and special
sampling and weighting strategies designed to mitigate bias.
- Exploration of individual dynamics and problems in music data improvement and harmonisation, and potential
stumbling blocks which may thwart data improvement projects, via desk research and stakeholder interviews; this will
include a legal-comparative study and an economic analysis.

These indicators are inputs for the future [Report on the European Music Economy](https://zenodo.org/record/6464782#.Ylq7JNpBzIU) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.6464782.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6464782) and the [Economy of music in Europe: Novel data collection methods and indicators](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6464990).
